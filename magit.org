* Section commands

These commands are for navigation and to change the visibility of
sections.

| Key                        | Description                                                       |
|----------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~TAB~                      | toggle body of current section                                    |
| ~C-<tab>~                  | cycle visibility of current section and its children              |
| ~M-<tab>~                  | cycle visibility of all diff sections                             |
| ~s-<tab>~                  | cycle visibility of all sections                                  |
| ~1~, ~2~, ~3~, ~4~         | show surrounding sections up to level N, hide deeper levels       |
| ~M-1~, ~M-2~, ~M-3~, ~M-4~ | globally show sections up to level N, hide deeper levels          |
| ~^~                        | goto parent section                                               |
| ~p~                        | goto beginning of section, from there to previous section         |
| ~n~                        | goto next section                                                 |
| ~M-p~                      | goto beginning of section, from there to previous sibling section |
| ~M-n~                      | goto next sibling section                                         |

* Buffer commands

| Key     | Description                                                                     |
|---------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~g~     | refresh current buffer and status buffer, possibly revert file-visiting buffers |
| ~G~     | refresh all Magit buffers and revert all file-visiting buffers in repository    |
| ~q~     | bury the current Magit buffer, restoring previous window configuration          |
| ~C-u q~ | kill the current Magit buffer, restoring previous window configuration          |

* Various common commands

| Key   | Description                                   |
|-------+-----------------------------------------------|
| ~SPC~ | scroll up (1)                                 |
| ~DEL~ | scroll down (1)                               |
| ~RET~ | show the thing at point in another buffer (2) |
| ~j~   | jump somewhere (3)                            |
| ~$~   | show output of recent calls to git            |

- (1) In most Magit buffers this scrolls the current buffer.
  In log buffers this instead scrolls the diff buffer shown
  in another window.
- (2) What is being shown depends on the context.
- (3) Where this jumps to depends on the context.

* Various assorted commands

| Key     | Description                   |
|---------+-------------------------------|
| ~i~     | add a gitignore rule globally |
| ~I~     | add a gitignore rule locally  |
| ~x~     | reset using ~--mixed~         |
| ~C-u x~ | reset using ~--hard~          |

* Prefix commands

These commands show popup buffers listing infix arguments and suffix
commands.  Note that you don't have to remember all these prefixes
initially - use ~h~ to show a popup listing all these prefixes as well
as many (but not all) of the commands that are not prefixes
themselves.

| Key      | Description          |
|----------+----------------------|
| ~A~      | cherry-pick          |
| ~b~      | branch               |
| ~B~      | bisect               |
| ~c~      | commit               |
| ~d~      | diff                 |
| ~E~      | ediff                |
| ~f~      | fetch                |
| ~F~      | pull                 |
| ~h~, ~?~ | show popup of popups |
| ~l~      | log                  |
| ~m~      | merge                |
| ~M~      | remote               |
| ~o~      | submodule            |
| ~P~      | push                 |
| ~r~      | rebase               |
| ~t~      | tag                  |
| ~T~      | note                 |
| ~V~      | revert               |
| ~w~      | apply patches        |
| ~C-u y~  | list refs (1)        |
| ~z~      | stash                |
| ~!~      | run git or gui tool  |

- (1) Actually ~y~ is bound to a popup/prefix command, but it is one of
  the few popups which default to a suffix command and therefor has to
  be called with a prefix argument to actually show the popup buffer.

* Applying changes

| Key | Description                    |
|-----+--------------------------------|
| ~a~ | apply the change at point      |
| ~k~ | discard the change at point    |
| ~s~ | stage the change at point      |
| ~S~ | stage all unstaged changes     |
| ~u~ | unstage the change at point    |
| ~U~ | unstage all staged changes (1) |
| ~v~ | reverse the change at point    |

- (1) Actually this asks for a commit to reset the index too.  If you
  just press ~RET~, then what this equivalent to unstaging everything.
  If that is to confusing then just bind this key to ~magit-unstage-all~.

* Diffing

These commands show diffs or manipulate the diff arguments used to
generate the diffs in the current buffer.

| Key   | Description                                   |
|-------+-----------------------------------------------|
| ~RET~ | (on commit) show commit                       |
| ~RET~ | (on stash) show stash                         |
| ~d~   | show diffing popup                            |
| ~D~   | show popup for changing diff arguments        |
| ~e~   | use ediff to stage, compare, or stage (dwim)  |
| ~E~   | show ediffing popup (for when dwimming fails) |
| ~+~   | show more context lines                       |
| ~-~   | show less context lines                       |
| ~0~   | show default amount of context lines (three)  |
